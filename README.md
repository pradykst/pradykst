### 🌟 A Little About Me

I'm a curious engineer who enjoys blurring the lines between *what is* and *what could be*.

Whether it’s creating decentralized apps that redefine payments, crafting VR game worlds with real economies, or hacking together tools that solve everyday problems — I love building stuff that feels *a bit ahead of its time*. I’m currently deep-diving into blockchain, immersive tech, and full-stack systems with a strong product mindset.

By day, I'm navigating engineering lectures; by night, I'm usually shipping a new feature or sketching out a dApp idea.

### 🛠️ Things I'm Playing With

- **Tech playground:** Solidity, Nuxt, React, Supabase, Prisma, Docker, Vue, Thirdweb, Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Where I live:** Somewhere between `console.log("frontend")` and `contract VaultX is ERC20`
- **Design meets Dev:** 3D modeling with Blender, building immersive AR/VR worlds, deploying full-stack apps that people actually use

---

### 🧪 Recent Experiments

🪙 **VaultX** — A DeFi super-app bringing crypto payments to everyday life. Think QR payments, NFT lending, marketplace, block explorer — all in one place.

🎮 **P3RKNexus** — A decentralized gaming hub that runs everything from browser puzzles to fully immersive VR games. Powered by ERC20 tokens, real utility, and a whole lot of Phaser + Unity magic.

👕 **UNITEE** — A campus merch store turned full-stack PWA. It started as a side project and turned into a live platform with real revenue and users.
